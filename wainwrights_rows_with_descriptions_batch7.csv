Despite its limited prominence from the surrounding terrain, Wainwright deemed it worthy of inclusion in his guides as a distinct fell. Most walkers encounter Watson's Dodd while following the ridge between Great Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd, with the summit being marked by a small cairn though the actual highest point is on featureless ground about 20 meters north. From the top, hikers enjoy excellent views across the Vale of Keswick to the Northwestern Fells, with particularly impressive perspectives of Blencathra to the north. The eastern slopes drop steeply toward St. John's in the Vale, while the western flanks descend more gradually toward Glencoyne and Ullswater. The predominantly grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with few rocky features to break the smooth contours that characterize this section of the Helvellyn range. Watson's Dodd exemplifies the more subtle, rounded fell tops that contrast with the dramatic craggy mountains found elsewhere in the Lake District, offering a gentler but no less rewarding experience for those exploring the Eastern Fells.

The fell derives its name from the Old Norse "hreysi" meaning a cairn or pile of stones. Most walkers encounter Raise while traversing the Helvellyn ridge, with direct approaches possible from Sticks Pass which crosses the fell's eastern shoulder and has served as an important route between the valleys since Norse times. The summit features a trig point and offers excellent views toward Ullswater and the Far Eastern Fells, with particularly impressive perspectives of Helvellyn's northern face. The eastern slopes are home to the Lake District Ski Club, established in 1936 and operating a modest ski tow when conditions permit, making Raise the only fell in the range to offer organized winter sports. The predominantly grassy upper slopes give way to steeper, rockier terrain on the eastern face above Keppel Cove, where a now-abandoned reservoir dam once supplied water to Glenridding's lead mines. The western flanks descend more gently toward Glencoyne, offering easy walking through typical Lakeland grassland dotted with outcrops of rock.

The mountain has a rich industrial heritage, with extensive copper mines on its eastern flanks dating back to Elizabethan times and slate quarrying that continued well into the 20th century. Most walkers approach from Coniston village via the well-established "tourist route" past the disused copper mines, though alternative paths exist from Walna Scar Road to the south or via the connecting ridge from Swirl How to the north. The summit features a trig point and stone wind shelter, offering spectacular panoramic views across the southern Lake District to Morecambe Bay, with particularly impressive perspectives of Dow Crag's eastern face across the dramatic glacial cirque of Goat's Water. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather moorland and eventually give way to bracken and the ancient deciduous woodland that lines the shores of Coniston Water. The Old Man features prominently in Arthur Ransome's "Swallows and Amazons" books as "Kanchenjunga," a mysterious mountain that the children aspire to climb.

The fell forms part of the ridge connecting Crag Hill to Causey Pike, creating a dramatic skyline visible from Keswick and the surrounding valleys. Most walkers encounter Sail while traversing the Coledale Horseshoe, with direct approaches possible from Rigg Beck in Newlands or from the Coledale valley to the north. The summit, marked by a simple cairn on a grassy dome, offers excellent views across the Northwestern Fells with particularly impressive perspectives of Crag Hill's precipitous eastern face. The eastern slopes have been dramatically altered by extensive erosion caused by heavy foot traffic, leading to a major restoration project by Fix the Fells that replaced the eroded "vertical mile" with a more sustainable zigzag path. The predominantly grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with few rocky features to break the smooth contours that characterize much of this section of the Northwestern Fells. Despite its modest height compared to some neighbors, Sail's distinctive profile and central position make it an important component of one of the Lake District's most popular and scenic ridge walks.

The fell's unusual name likely derives from "Sunnen's Crag," named after a now-forgotten Norse settler, later altered by Christian influence. Most walkers approach from Patterdale via the path to Grisedale Tarn before ascending the steep southeastern ridge, or via the connecting ridge from Fairfield as part of the popular Deepdale Horseshoe route. The summit plateau features a cairn, though slightly higher ground can be found just northwest, offering spectacular views across Ullswater and toward the Helvellyn range, with particularly impressive perspectives of Fairfield's northern face. The northeastern slopes drop precipitously toward Grisedale through a series of imposing crags that provide challenging scrambling and climbing routes, while the southwestern flanks descend more gradually toward Deepdale. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species, while the lower reaches feature areas of heather and bilberry that give way to bracken and eventually the ancient deciduous woodland that clings to the lower Grisedale valley. The fell's distinctive profile and excellent summit views make it a popular objective despite the steep ascent required from most directions.

The fell's name likely derives from the pale, grassy eastern slopes that appear almost white in certain light conditions, particularly when the surrounding terrain is in shadow. Most walkers approach from Buttermere via the clearly defined ridge ascending from Whiteless Breast, or as part of a traverse from Wandope to Rannerdale Knotts. The rocky summit, marked by a small cairn, offers exceptional panoramic views across Buttermere and Crummock Water to the High Stile range, with particularly impressive perspectives down the length of the Buttermere valley. The eastern slopes drop steeply toward Rannerdale, scene of a legendary ambush where local Cumbrians reportedly defeated Norman invaders in the 12th century. The predominantly grassy terrain gives way to areas of heather and bilberry on the middle slopes, while the lower reaches feature bracken and scattered rowans and hawthorns in the more sheltered gullies. Despite its modest height compared to neighboring peaks, Whiteless Pike's distinctive profile, excellent views, and position on one of the Lake District's most scenic ridges ensure its popularity with walkers exploring the Northwestern Fells.

The mountain forms the western end of the High Stile range, creating an impressive wall of crags above Buttermere lake. Most walkers approach from Buttermere village via the path through Burtness Wood before making the steep ascent up Lingcomb Edge, or via the connecting ridge from High Stile as part of a traverse of the entire range. The summit features a cairn with the actual highest ground being a few meters south, offering spectacular views across Crummock Water, Ennerdale, and toward the Solway Firth and Scottish hills beyond. The eastern face drops dramatically toward Buttermere through a series of impressive crags, while the western slopes descend more gradually toward Ennerdale. The mountain's distinctive red coloration is particularly striking in evening sunlight, contrasting with the surrounding greenery and the blue waters of Crummock Water and Buttermere. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species, while the lower reaches feature areas of heather and bilberry that give way to bracken and eventually the ancient oak woodland of Burtness Wood along the shore of Buttermere.

The mountain's name derives from the Old English "heah stigel" meaning "high stile or steep ascent." Most walkers approach via the connecting ridges from either Red Pike to the west or High Crag to the east, creating one of the Lake District's finest high-level traverses, though direct ascents are possible from Buttermere via Burtness Comb, a dramatic glacial cirque on the northern face. The summit, marked by a cairn amid rocky terrain, offers exceptional panoramic views across much of the Lake District, with particularly impressive perspectives of Crummock Water, Buttermere, and the Grasmoor range beyond. The northern face drops dramatically through a series of imposing crags into Burtness Comb, which contains a small tarn nestled beneath the towering rock walls. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes give way to heather moorland and eventually the wooded shores of Buttermere. The high ridge between Red Pike and High Crag represents one of the most dramatic and sustained high-level walks in the Lake District, combining excellent views with impressive mountain architecture.

The mountain presents dramatically different aspects depending on the viewpoint, with imposing crags on its northern face contrasting with the steep but less precipitous southern slopes descending toward Ennerdale. Most walkers approach via the connecting ridge from High Stile, or from Scarth Gap pass when ascending from Buttermere or Ennerdale. The modest summit cairn occupies a relatively narrow ridge, offering spectacular views across Buttermere and Crummock Water to the Grasmoor range, with equally impressive perspectives of the Scafell range to the south. The descent to Scarth Gap on the eastern side is particularly steep and extensively eroded, making it challenging especially in wet or icy conditions. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower northern slopes give way to scattered woodland including the distinctive Scots pines that dot the southern shore of Buttermere. Despite being the lowest of the three main summits on the High Stile ridge, High Crag's dramatic profile and position ensure it remains an essential component of one of the Lake District's finest mountain walks.
