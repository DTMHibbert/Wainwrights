Its broad, heather-covered slopes and relatively isolated position make it a peaceful fell to explore despite being overshadowed by its higher neighbors. Most walkers approach from Mosedale or via the connecting ridge from Skiddaw, with the summit being marked by a small cairn at the highest point of the broad ridge. From the top, hikers enjoy expansive views of Skiddaw, Blencathra, and across to the Pennines on clear days. The extensive heather moorland provides important habitat for red grouse and other upland birds, while the lower slopes feature areas of acid grassland typical of the Northern Fells. Great Calva is often incorporated into longer walks traversing multiple peaks rather than being a destination in its own right.
2332,Bannerdale Crags,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Westmorland and Furness,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5S,684.1,2244,NY335290,NY 33530 29026,37,NY331296,647,rock 3m NE of pile of stones,,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=433530&Y=529026&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.650892,-3.028749",Bannerdale Crags derives its name from the dramatic eastern face where steep crags drop sharply into the glacial valley of Bannerdale. The fell forms part of the horseshoe of mountains surrounding the River Glenderamackin, creating one of the most scenic and less-visited valleys in the Northern Fells. Most walkers approach from the village of Mungrisdale or via the connecting ridges from Blencathra or Bowscale Fell. The summit area features a small rocky outcrop with a pile of stones nearby, offering outstanding views eastward toward the Eden Valley and Pennines. The impressive eastern crags provide habitat for ravens and occasionally peregrine falcons, while the western slopes consist of more gentle terrain descending toward Blackhazel Beck. Geologically, the fell consists primarily of Skiddaw Slates, the oldest rock formation in the Lake District, dating back some 500 million years.
2333,Bakestall,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4N OL4S,673.5,2210,NY266307,NY 26631 30738,10.6,NY 2658 3055,663,ground 15m SW of cairn,Wainwright summit probably at cairn at NY 26644 30744,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=426631&Y=530738&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.674707,-3.141286",Bakestall occupies the northern slopes of the Skiddaw massif, forming a minor subsidiary summit that was nonetheless deemed worthy of inclusion in Wainwright's guides. The fell offers a quieter alternative to the busy summit of Skiddaw, with most walkers reaching it via the path from Dash Falls or by descending north from Skiddaw itself. Its most distinctive feature is the deep ravine on its eastern face carved by Whitewater Dash, one of the Lake District's most impressive waterfalls. From the modest summit cairn, visitors enjoy excellent views northward toward the Solway Firth and the hills of Scotland beyond. The upper slopes are predominantly covered in grass and heather, while the lower reaches give way to bracken and scattered woodland along the course of Dash Beck. The fell's relative isolation means it's often overlooked by hikers heading for Skiddaw, providing a sense of solitude rare on the more popular Lake District mountains.

Geologically unique among the Northern Fells, Carrock consists of gabbro rock rather than the Skiddaw slate that forms most of its neighbors, creating its distinctive dark appearance. Most walkers approach from the east via Carrspout Gill or from the west along the connecting ridge from High Pike. The summit area features a large cairn and wind shelter, offering expansive views across the Eden Valley to the Pennines and north toward the Scottish border. The steep northern slopes drop dramatically into the wooded Mosedale valley, creating a stark contrast with the more gentle southern aspects. The fell's name derives from the Celtic "caer" meaning fort and "carreg" meaning rock, reflecting both its history and geology.
2337,High Pike (Caldbeck),Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5N,658,2159,NY318350,NY 31877 35001,68,NY 3026 3350,589.9,large cairn/windshelter,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=431877&Y=535001&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.718876,-3.062534",High Pike stands as the northernmost of all Wainwright's fells, commanding the high ground between the Caldbeck Fells and the main Northern Fells group. The mountain has a rich mining heritage, with numerous disused lead mines dotting its northern slopes, particularly around the aptly named hamlet of Nether Row. Most walkers approach from the village of Caldbeck via a well-maintained track that leads directly to the summit, making it one of the more accessible of the Northern Fells. The broad summit plateau features a large cairn, wind shelter, and trig point, offering exceptional views north across the Solway Firth to Scotland and the distant hills of Galloway. The gentle grassy slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, while the lower reaches give way to improved pasture and eventually the lush valleys of Caldbeck and Parkend. The fell forms part of a popular horseshoe walk taking in Carrock Fell and several other summits in the northern Lake District.

Despite its impressive name, the fell has a rather modest appearance, consisting mainly of a broad, grassy dome with gentle slopes on all sides. Most walkers reach it as part of a longer traverse of the Northern Fells, with direct approaches possible from Mosedale to the west or via the connecting ridges from neighboring summits. The unassuming summit is marked by a small cairn and offers particularly good views of Uldale Fells and across to the Solway Firth and Scotland beyond. The fell's extensive grassy slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, while the western flanks descend more steeply toward the remote and peaceful Mosedale valley. Although overshadowed by its higher neighbors, Great Sca Fell provides an important link in the chain of peaks that form the backbone of the Northern Fells.

The fell consists of a vast, gently sloping plateau with minimal prominence from its surroundings, lacking any distinctive features or dramatic profiles. Most walkers reach it via the connecting ridges from Blencathra or Great Calva, with no clear path leading directly to the summit. The highest point is marked only by a small cairn in an otherwise featureless expanse of grass, heather, and occasional boggy patches. Despite its modest character, the fell offers expansive views toward Skiddaw, Blencathra, and across the Eden Valley to the Pennines on clear days. The extensive plateau provides important upland habitat for ground-nesting birds including skylarks and meadow pipits. Wainwright himself questioned its inclusion in his guides, yet it remains an objective for completists tackling all 214 fells.
2344,Brae Fell,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4N,586,1923,NY288351,NY 28875 35159,14,NY289348,572,large cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=428875&Y=535159&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.719526,-3.108850",Brae Fell stands at the northern end of the main ridge of the Northern Fells, forming a rounded dome that drops away steeply on its eastern side toward the valley of Roughten Gill. The fell offers a sense of remoteness and isolation, being among the least-visited of Wainwright's summits due to its distance from popular starting points. Most walkers approach via the connecting ridge from Great Sca Fell or from the hamlet of Longlands to the north. The summit features a large cairn and provides outstanding panoramic views northward across the Solway Plain to Scotland and eastward toward the Pennines. The broad, grassy slopes support typical upland vegetation and provide grazing for hardy Herdwick sheep. The western flanks descend gently into the secluded upper reaches of Mosedale, while the eastern face drops more dramatically toward Roughten Gill, which was once an important mining area yielding lead, copper, and barite.

The fell serves as an important transition between the higher North Western Fells and the lower wooded hills that extend toward Keswick and Derwentwater. Most walkers approach from the Whinlatter Visitor Centre via well-maintained forest tracks that eventually emerge onto open fellside for the final ascent. The summit features a distinctive outcrop with an iron post nearby, offering superb views across Bassenthwaite Lake toward Skiddaw and the Northern Fells. The extensive forest slopes provide important habitat for wildlife including red squirrels and numerous woodland birds, contrasting with the open heather moorland of the summit area. The fell is often combined with nearby Barf or Broom Fell to create a satisfying half-day circuit that balances woodland paths with open fell walking.
