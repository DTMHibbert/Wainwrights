The mountain features three significant gullies on its northern face—Central Gully, Cust's Gully, and South-East Gully—which provide challenging winter climbing routes that have been popular with mountaineers since the early days of the sport. Most walkers approach from Seathwaite in Borrowdale or via the corridor route from Sty Head, with the summit plateau being marked by a cairn on a rocky outcrop. From the top, hikers enjoy spectacular views of the central Lakeland fells, with particularly dramatic perspectives of the Scafell massif and Great Gable. The stark, rocky landscape of the summit supports minimal vegetation, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather moorland and hardy montane grassland. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by its higher neighbors, Great End offers some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in England and serves as an important stopping point on the popular traverse of the Scafell range.

The fell features distinctive geological formations including the Great Slab, a vast tilted plane of smooth rock on its eastern face, and the Band, a prominent ridge descending eastward toward Langdale. Most walkers approach from either Langdale via the Band or from Eskdale via the Esk Hause pass, with the rocky summit offering exceptional panoramic views across much of the Lake District. Particularly impressive are the vistas down Langdale and toward the Scafell range, with the precipitous face of Scafell Crag being especially dramatic. The upper reaches consist primarily of bare rock and scree, supporting only the hardiest alpine plants in sheltered crevices, while the lower slopes feature heather moorland and eventually give way to bracken and woodland along the valley floors. The popular horseshoe walk incorporating Crinkle Crags, Bowfell, and Esk Pike ranks among the finest high-level mountain routes in England, traversing dramatic terrain with constantly changing perspectives.

The mountain has profound historical significance, having been gifted to the National Trust in 1923 as a memorial to members of the Fell & Rock Climbing Club who died in World War I, with an annual Remembrance Day service still held at its summit. Most walkers approach from either Wasdale Head via Sty Head or from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, with the rocky summit offering spectacular 360-degree views, particularly of Wastwater and the Scafell range. The fell is also significant in climbing history, with Napes Needle on its southern flank being the birthplace of rock climbing as a recreational sport in Britain. The upper slopes consist almost entirely of bare rock and scree, supporting minimal vegetation, while the lower reaches feature areas of heather, bilberry, and eventually give way to bracken and woodland in the valleys. The col of Windy Gap separates Great Gable from its neighbor Green Gable, creating a dramatic notch in the skyline when viewed from the east or west.

The mountain derives its name from this distinctive rock feature, which was first climbed in 1826 and remains a challenging objective for modern climbers. Most walkers approach from Wasdale Head via the Black Sail Pass or from Ennerdale via the Pillar High Level Route, a thrilling but exposed path that traverses the northern crags. The summit, marked by a trig point, offers exceptional views across Ennerdale to the High Stile range and west toward the Irish Sea coast. The eastern slopes drop dramatically into Mosedale, while the western aspect descends more gradually toward Ennerdale Forest, with the upper reaches consisting primarily of rocky terrain giving way to grassland and eventually woodland on the lower slopes. Pillar's relatively remote position and the challenging nature of all its ascent routes ensure it remains less frequented than many Lake District mountains of similar stature, preserving a sense of wilderness even during peak seasons.

The fell offers some of the finest ridge walking in the Lake District, combining dramatic rocky terrain with relatively straightforward navigation along its well-defined spine. Most walkers approach from Great Langdale via the Band or from Three Tarns col, which connects the fell to Bowfell to the north. The highest point features a cairn perched on a rocky outcrop, offering magnificent views across Great Langdale and toward the Scafell range, with particularly impressive perspectives of Bowfell's Great Slab. The famous "Bad Step," a short rock face on the north side of the second crinkle, provides a memorable scrambling challenge that can be bypassed by those seeking an easier route. The predominantly rocky terrain supports limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes give way to heather moorland and eventually the verdant valley of Oxendale. Wainwright described the traverse of Crinkle Crags as "the finest ridge mile in Lakeland," a sentiment echoed by generations of hill walkers who have enjoyed its perfectly proportioned peaks and troughs.

The mountain's name derives from the extensive grass-covered slopes on its eastern face, which contrast with the more rugged craggy aspects on its western and northern sides. Most walkers approach from Lanthwaite Green via Gasgale Gill or the steep slope of Lad Hows, with alternative routes available from Coledale Hause or Crag Hill to the east. The broad summit plateau features a substantial wind shelter constructed from the local slate, from which hikers enjoy magnificent panoramas across Crummock Water and Buttermere to the High Stile range and westward toward the Solway Firth and Irish Sea. The eastern face drops dramatically into Coledale, while extensive scree slopes descend the western flanks toward Crummock Water, creating striking visual features visible from miles around. The predominantly grassy upper slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, while lower down, patches of heather and bilberry add color to the landscape during summer and autumn, with scattered rowans and hawthorns appearing in the more sheltered gullies.

The summit plateau is bisected by a stone wall, with the highest point being a rocky outcrop just north of this boundary divider. Most walkers encounter Scoat Fell while traversing the ridge between Red Pike and Pillar, approaching via either Black Sail Pass from Wasdale or from Ennerdale. The summit offers excellent views across both valleys, with particularly impressive perspectives of Pillar's imposing northern face. The fell's most distinctive feature is Steeple, a dramatic rocky pinnacle extending northward from the main ridge, which is considered a separate Wainwright despite its modest prominence. The predominantly rocky terrain supports limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species in sheltered locations, while the lower slopes feature areas of grassland and heather moorland. Though lacking the individual prominence of some of its neighbors, Scoat Fell forms an essential link in one of the Lake District's finest high-level traverses, connecting the impressive peaks that form the skyline between Wasdale and Ennerdale.

Despite its name, the mountain features a predominantly grassy dome-shaped summit, while its more craggy aspects are found on the eastern face where dramatic cliffs drop steeply into the Coledale valley. Most walkers approach via the connecting ridges from Grasmoor, Sail, or Wandope, or directly from Coledale Hause when ascending from Braithwaite or Buttermere. The broad summit area features a cairn though the actual highest point is on featureless ground nearby, offering exceptional panoramic views across the Lake District with particularly impressive perspectives of Grasmoor and the Buttermere valley. The eastern crags provide important nesting sites for ravens and occasionally peregrine falcons, while the extensive grassy slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing. Crag Hill forms an essential component of the popular Coledale Horseshoe walk, one of the classic ridge circuits in the Lake District that takes in numerous summits while maintaining consistently high elevation.
