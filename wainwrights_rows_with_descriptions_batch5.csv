The mountain is renowned for its dramatic eastern face where two narrow, precipitous ridges—Striding Edge and Swirral Edge—provide some of the most exciting ridge walking in England, encircling the glacial hollow of Red Tarn. Most walkers approach from either Glenridding via Striding Edge, from Thirlmere via the gentler western slopes, or from Wythburn through Nethermost Cove. The broad, gently rounded summit plateau features a trig point, cross-shaped wind shelter, and a memorial to Charles Gough whose tragic death on the mountain in 1805 inspired poetry by Wordsworth and Scott. From the top, hikers enjoy spectacular panoramic views across the entire Lake District, with particularly impressive perspectives eastward toward Ullswater and the Far Eastern Fells. The mountain has significant historical importance in British aviation as the site where Windermere pilot Bert Hinkler made the first successful landing of an airplane on a mountain in 1926. The upper slopes support specialized alpine vegetation adapted to the harsh conditions, including the rare Schelly's saxifrage which grows nowhere else in England.
2376,Skiddaw Little Man,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,HHB,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,865,2838,NY266277,NY 26676 27792,60.6,NY 2650 2808,804.4,rock 5m N of cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=426676&Y=527792&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.638126,-3.141448",Skiddaw Little Man stands as a distinctive peak on the southern shoulder of its parent mountain, Skiddaw, creating an appealing profile when viewed from Keswick. Though sometimes considered merely a subsidiary summit, this fell has earned its place as a Wainwright in its own right due to its distinct character and the fine views it offers. The most popular ascent route is via the well-maintained path from Keswick that continues on to Skiddaw, making it a frequent stopping point for those tackling the larger mountain. From its summit, marked by a small cairn near a rocky outcrop, walkers enjoy spectacular views of Derwentwater, Keswick, and the surrounding northern fells. The exposed position means the peak often experiences strong winds, but the clearly defined path makes it accessible for moderately experienced hikers. The grassy slopes support hardy upland vegetation, with occasional patches of heather adding color during late summer, while the lower reaches merge seamlessly with the broader Skiddaw massif.
2377,High Street,Lake District - Far Eastern Fells,EL06,Westmorland and Furness,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,HHB,W,B,Sy,Fel",90 91,OL5N,827.9,2717,NY439111,NY 43970 11127,533.3,NY 4207 0757,294.6,trig point,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=443970&Y=511127&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.490283,-2.861955",High Street derives its intriguing name from the Roman road that traversed its summit plateau, connecting forts at Brougham (Brocavum) and Ambleside (Galava). The mountain forms the highest point of the Far Eastern Fells, creating a lengthy north-south ridge that acts as a watershed between the valleys of Kentmere, Troutbeck, and Haweswater. Most walkers approach from Mardale Head near Haweswater via the dramatic Riggindale ridge, from Kentmere via Nan Bield Pass, or from Patterdale via Angle Tarn. The broad, gently sloping summit plateau features a trig point and offers expansive panoramic views across the eastern Lake District to the Pennines and, on exceptionally clear days, as far as the Yorkshire Three Peaks. The mountain hosts an annual fell race that follows the ancient Roman road, while in winter, the western slopes once supported a ski club with a rudimentary tow operating until the 1970s. The high grazing land has supported sheep farming for centuries, with the remains of ancient stone penning systems still visible, while the eastern slopes drop dramatically into Riggindale, previously home to England's last resident golden eagle until its disappearance in 2016.

The mountain is separated from Scafell Pike by the treacherous Broad Stand, a near-vertical rock face that forces hikers to make significant detours to pass between the two summits. Most walkers approach from Wasdale via either Lord's Rake or Foxes Tarn, with both routes involving steep, challenging ascents through dramatic mountain scenery. The summit features a cairn perched on rock near a stone wind shelter, offering spectacular views across the central Lake District and particularly impressive perspectives of the Great Gable massif. The mountain's eastern face includes Scafell Crag, one of Britain's most historic and challenging rock climbing venues where many pioneering routes were established. The upper slopes consist almost entirely of bare rock and scree, creating a harsh alpine environment where only the most specialized plants survive in sheltered crevices, while the lower slopes give way to heather moorland and eventually verdant valleys.

The mountain features a broad, stony summit plateau that can be notoriously difficult to navigate in poor visibility, with steep slopes falling away on all sides. Most walkers approach via the classic Fairfield Horseshoe route from Ambleside, ascending through Rydal and returning via Loughrigg, though challenging alternatives exist from Patterdale over St Sunday Crag. The summit is marked by several large cairns, with the highest point being at the southern end of the plateau, offering spectacular panoramic views across much of the Lake District with particularly impressive perspectives of Helvellyn and the Scafell range. The eastern slopes drop dramatically into Deepdale through a series of impressive crags, providing important habitat for ravens and occasionally peregrine falcons. The predominantly rocky terrain supports limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather moorland and eventually give way to bracken and the ancient deciduous woodland that lines the shores of Rydal Water.

The fell's name derives from its position as the most distant (i.e., "nethermost") of the peaks visible from the valley of Grisedale. Most hikers encounter Nethermost Pike while traversing the ridge between Helvellyn and Dollywaggon Pike, with direct ascents possible from Grisedale via Nethermost Cove or from Wythburn Church on Thirlmere's eastern shore. The summit features a small cairn on a rocky outcrop at the eastern edge of the broad ridge, offering superb views toward Ullswater and the Far Eastern Fells. The eastern face drops dramatically through a series of crags into Nethermost Cove, contrasting with the gentler grassy slopes that descend westward toward Thirlmere. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike has a distinct character and provides excellent high-level walking, particularly for those exploring the full length of the Helvellyn ridge. The fell's eastern coves and crags support specialized arctic-alpine flora that survived from the last ice age, while the western slopes feature areas of heather moorland and hardy grasses.

The fell derives its name from the expanses of grass that cover much of its upper slopes, contrasting with the rockier terrain of its larger neighbor. Most walkers encounter Green Gable while traversing between Great Gable and Brandreth or Base Brown, with numerous approach routes available from Borrowdale, Ennerdale, and Wasdale. The summit, marked by a simple cairn on a grassy dome, offers exceptional panoramic views with particularly impressive perspectives of Great Gable's northern face and down into the dramatic glacial valley of Ennerdale. The col of Windy Gap separates Green Gable from Great Gable, creating a dramatic notch that provides a challenging but non-technical scramble between the two peaks. The predominantly grassy upper slopes support hardy mountain vegetation, while the lower eastern slopes drop steeply toward Styhead Tarn and are bisected by Aaron Slack, a loose scree gully that provides a direct but challenging descent route to Styhead Pass.
2382,Blencathra,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Westmorland and Furness,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,HHB,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5S,867.8,2847,NY323277,NY 32345 27708,461,NY296287,407,rock 1m N of trig point,ground 30m W at NY 32314 27710 may be of similar height,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=432345&Y=527708&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.638347,-3.049384",Blencathra, also known historically as Saddleback, ranks among the most distinctive and dramatic mountains in the Lake District, presenting a complex series of ridges and gullies on its southern face. The mountain consists of six separate fell tops, with Hallsfell Top being the highest and bearing the summit trig point and a nearby rocky outcrop marking the true summit. Most walkers approach from Threlkeld via one of the many ridges, with Sharp Edge providing an exhilarating scramble for experienced hikers and Halls Fell Ridge offering an equally dramatic but slightly less exposed alternative. From the summit, climbers are rewarded with expansive views over the Solway Firth, the Eden Valley toward the Pennines, and much of the Lake District. Blencathra's geological makeup consists primarily of Skiddaw slate, the oldest rock formation in the Lake District, dating back some 500 million years. The extensive slopes support resilient upland vegetation and provide habitat for birds of prey including peregrine falcons and ravens, while the fell has been a backdrop for local sheep farming for centuries.
2383,Ill Bell,Lake District - Far Eastern Fells,EL06,Westmorland and Furness,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL7N,756.7,2482,NY431073,NY 43120 07351,146.1,NY 4326 0691,610.6,highest of 3 cairns,,very obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=443120&Y=507351&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.456364,-2.875628",Ill Bell rises as a perfect pyramidal peak along the spectacular ridge connecting Froswick to Yoke, creating one of the most distinctive skylines in the Eastern Lake District. The fell derives its name from the Old Norse "Hyll Bjall" meaning "hill bell," aptly describing its striking bell-shaped profile when viewed from certain angles. Most walkers encounter Ill Bell while traversing the popular Kentmere Horseshoe route, approaching via the connecting ridges from either Froswick to the north or Yoke to the south. The distinctive summit features three large cairns arranged in a line along its narrow ridge, with the central one being the highest, offering spectacular panoramic views across the Lake District with particularly impressive perspectives of the Scafell range to the west. The eastern slopes drop dramatically toward Kentmere Reservoir through a series of rocky outcrops, while the western flanks descend more gently toward Troutbeck. The predominantly rocky upper reaches support hardy montane vegetation, while lower slopes feature areas of bracken, heather, and hardy sheep-grazed grassland that has sustained the farming communities of Kentmere and Troutbeck for centuries.
