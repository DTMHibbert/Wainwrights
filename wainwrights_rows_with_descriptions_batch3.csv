The fell's name is thought to derive from the Old Norse "melr" meaning sand bank, perhaps referring to its rounded, smooth appearance. Most walkers approach via the connecting ridge from Great Cockup or from the remote valley of Mosedale, with the summit being marked by a small cairn perched on the highest point. From the top, hikers enjoy expansive views across the Solway Plain to Scotland and excellent perspectives of the higher Northern Fells including Skiddaw and Blencathra. The grassy upper slopes give way to heather and bracken on the lower reaches, providing habitat for ground-nesting birds and grazing for hardy Herdwick sheep. The fell is often combined with Great Cockup and Brae Fell to create a satisfying circuit of the valleys and ridges in this quiet corner of the Lake District.

This modest fell forms the northern wall of the secluded Mosedale valley, creating a shapely profile when viewed from the south. Most walkers approach from Orthwaite to the west or via the connecting ridge from Meal Fell, with the summit being marked by a small cairn offering excellent views across the Northern Fells. The southern slopes drop steeply into Mosedale, while the northern aspect descends more gently toward the pastoral landscape around Orthwaite. The extensive grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with patches of heather and bilberry adding color to the landscape in summer and autumn. Despite being overshadowed by higher neighbors, Great Cockup provides an essential component in the horseshoe of hills that surround Mosedale, making it a popular inclusion in circular walks exploring this quieter area of the Northern Fells.

The fell forms a long, narrow ridge extending southeast from Blencathra, creating a striking profile when viewed from the valley of the River Glenderamackin. Most walkers approach from the village of Mungrisdale to the north or via the connecting ridge from Blencathra. The grassy summit, marked by a small rocky outcrop, offers superb views of Blencathra's impressive eastern face and across the Eden Valley to the distant Pennines. The extensive grassy slopes support sheep grazing, while the steeper western flank drops dramatically toward the River Glenderamackin. The fell provides one of the easiest ascents in the Northern Fells, making it popular with families and less experienced hikers seeking outstanding views with minimal effort.

The fell is now managed by the Forestry Commission with well-maintained paths through mixed woodland comprising primarily spruce, larch, and oak trees. Most walkers approach from the Old Sawmill tea room car park via clearly marked trails that wind through the forest to the summit. From the top, marked by a stone monument, visitors enjoy spectacular views over Bassenthwaite Lake, Derwentwater, and toward the Solway Firth. The wooded slopes provide important habitat for red squirrels and numerous woodland birds, while the fell has gained fame as a prime location for watching ospreys, which have nested near Bassenthwaite since 2001. The combination of woodland paths, manageable gradients, and outstanding viewpoints makes Dodd extremely popular with families and casual walkers seeking a relatively easy ascent with considerable rewards.

The fell offers one of the easiest ascents among Wainwright's mountains, with most walkers approaching from Longlands via a clear farm track that leads onto the open fellside. Despite its modest height, the summit cairn commands superb panoramic views, particularly northward across the Solway Plain to Scotland and the distant hills of Galloway. The gentle, grassy slopes support sheep grazing, while the lower reaches give way to improved pasture and scattered woodland. Longlands Fell is often combined with nearby Brae Fell and Lowthwaite Fell to create a satisfying circuit of the northwestern corner of the Northern Fells. The area's relative remoteness from popular tourist centers ensures a sense of solitude even during peak holiday periods, making it a tranquil alternative to the busier fells further south.

The fell's distinctive dome-shape and isolated position have made it a significant landmark since prehistoric times, with evidence of ancient settlements on its slopes. Most walkers approach from the small parking area at Binsey Lodge to the north, following a clearly defined path to the summit. The top features a trig point and wind shelter, offering magnificent panoramic views that extend from the Solway Firth and Scotland to the north, the full sweep of the Lake District mountains to the south, and the Pennines to the east. The grassy slopes support sheep grazing, while in spring and summer, the lower reaches burst into color with wildflowers including bluebells in the scattered woodland areas. Binsey's modest height and gentle gradients make it an ideal introductory fell for novice walkers and families, while its isolated position ensures the views remain disproportionately impressive for a mountain of such modest stature.

The fell is particularly beloved for its spectacular views over Derwentwater and the surrounding mountains, often described as one of the finest panoramas in the Lake District relative to the minimal effort required to attain it. Most walkers approach from the dedicated car park on its southern slopes, following a well-maintained path that includes disabled access to a viewpoint part way up. The grassy summit lacks any prominent features but offers unrivaled views of Keswick, Derwentwater, and the dramatic skyline of mountains including Skiddaw directly behind. The southern slopes support mixed woodland and gorse, providing habitat for numerous bird species and occasional red squirrels. Latrigg's accessibility and modest height make it extremely popular with families, casual walkers, and photographers seeking stunning sunset views over Derwentwater without committing to a challenging mountain ascent.

The mountain consists primarily of igneous rock formed from volcanic activity 450 million years ago, creating the distinctive boulder-strewn landscape of its upper slopes. Multiple routes of ascent exist, with the most popular approaches being from Wasdale Head, Borrowdale, or via the Corridor Route from Sty Head. The summit plateau, marked by a large cairn and trig point, offers breathtaking panoramic views that can extend to Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man on exceptionally clear days. The mountain was gifted to the National Trust in 1919 by Lord Leconfield as a war memorial, with a plaque at the summit commemorating this dedication to the fallen of World War I. The harsh environment supports specialized alpine vegetation that survives in the cracks between the andesite and rhyolite rocks, while the lower slopes feature heather moorland giving way to oak woodland in the valleys.

The mountain is separated from Scafell Pike by the treacherous Broad Stand, a near-vertical rock face that forces hikers to make significant detours to pass between the two summits. Most walkers approach from Wasdale via either Lord's Rake or Foxes Tarn, with both routes involving steep, challenging ascents through dramatic mountain scenery. The summit features a cairn perched on rock near a stone wind shelter, offering spectacular views across the central Lake District and particularly impressive perspectives of the Great Gable massif. The mountain's eastern face includes Scafell Crag, one of Britain's most historic and challenging rock climbing venues where many pioneering routes were established. The upper slopes consist almost entirely of bare rock and scree, creating a harsh alpine environment where only the most specialized plants survive in sheltered crevices, while the lower slopes give way to heather moorland and eventually verdant valleys.
