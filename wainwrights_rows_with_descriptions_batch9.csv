The fell's unusual name likely derives from a corruption of the Old Norse "seter-mann" meaning "the dairy man's hill," referring to its historical use for summer grazing. Most walkers approach from either Grasmere via Easedale Tarn and Belles Knott, or encounter it while traversing between High Raise and Pavey Ark above Langdale. The summit, marked by a distinctive rocky outcrop, offers exceptional panoramic views across much of the Lake District, with particularly impressive perspectives of the Langdale Pikes and down into Easedale. The northeastern slopes drop steeply toward Easedale Tarn through a series of rocky outcrops, while the southwestern aspect merges more gently with the broad plateau of High Raise. The predominantly rocky upper terrain supports hardy montane vegetation in sheltered niches, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather and bilberry that give way to bracken on the descent toward Easedale. Despite having limited prominence from its parent fell High Raise, Sergeant Man's distinctive rocky crown and strategic position overlooking both Langdale and Easedale ensure it remains a popular objective for walkers exploring the Central Fells.

The mountain has significant archaeological importance as the site of a Neolithic axe factory, with the distinctive volcanic tuff stone being quarried and crafted into stone axes that were traded across Britain some 6,000 years ago. Most walkers approach from New Dungeon Ghyll via Stickle Ghyll and the Band, or along the ridge from Harrison Stickle via Loft Crag, with the final ascent involving a short but exhilarating scramble to the summit rocks. From the top, hikers enjoy spectacular views across Great Langdale toward the Coniston fells and Scafell range, with particularly impressive perspectives of Bowfell's northeastern face. The southern slopes drop precipitously into Great Langdale through a series of rocky outcrops and scree slopes, while the northern aspect descends more gradually toward Mickleden. The remains of the Neolithic axe factory can still be found on the eastern face, with worked stone and evidence of manufacturing visible to those who venture off the main paths. Pike of Stickle's distinctive profile, archaeological significance, and the exciting scramble to its summit ensure its popularity with walkers exploring this central part of the Lake District.
2418,High Crag,Lake District - Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89,OL4S,742.9,2437,NY177142,NY 17768 14292,59.7,NY 1705 1488,683.1,small cairn,,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=417768&Y=514292&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.515421,-3.269141",High Crag forms the eastern terminal of the magnificent ridge that includes High Stile and Red Pike, creating one of the Lake District's most impressive mountain profiles when viewed from Buttermere. The mountain presents dramatically different aspects depending on the viewpoint, with imposing crags on its northern face contrasting with the steep but less precipitous southern slopes descending toward Ennerdale. Most walkers approach via the connecting ridge from High Stile, or from Scarth Gap pass when ascending from Buttermere or Ennerdale. The modest summit cairn occupies a relatively narrow ridge, offering spectacular views across Buttermere and Crummock Water to the Grasmoor range, with equally impressive perspectives of the Scafell range to the south. The descent to Scarth Gap on the eastern side is particularly steep and extensively eroded, making it challenging especially in wet or icy conditions. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower northern slopes give way to scattered woodland including the distinctive Scots pines that dot the southern shore of Buttermere. Despite being the lowest of the three main summits on the High Stile ridge, High Crag's dramatic profile and position ensure it remains an essential component of one of the Lake District's finest mountain walks.
