The fell derives its name from the Old Norse "fljot-hveit" meaning "flat piece of land by the stream." Most walkers approach from Honister Pass via the well-defined track that follows the dramatic spine of Fleetwith Edge, offering constantly expanding views as height is gained. The summit, marked by a stone wind shelter, offers spectacular panoramic views of Buttermere, Crummock Water, and surrounding fells, with the perspective down the steep face to Buttermere being particularly impressive. The northern slopes drop precipitously into Honister Pass, where the remains of extensive slate quarrying operations remind visitors of the area's industrial heritage. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather and bilberry that give way to bracken and scattered trees, particularly along the course of Warnscale Beck. Despite its modest height compared to some neighboring mountains, Fleetwith Pike's dramatic profile, historic associations with Lake District slate mining, and the exhilarating traverse of Fleetwith Edge ensure its popularity with walkers seeking a relatively short but spectacular mountain experience.
2403,Red Screes,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Westmorland and Furness,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL7N,775.7,2545,NY396086,NY 39694 08673,363,NY 3867 0915,412.7,trig point,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=439694&Y=508673&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.468107,-2.938976",Red Screes derives its descriptive name from the reddish-colored scree slopes that dominate its eastern face, particularly prominent when lit by early morning sunlight. The mountain occupies a commanding position at the head of both the Kirkstone Pass and Scandale, creating an imposing barrier between the valleys of Ambleside and Patterdale. Most walkers approach from either Kirkstone Pass via the steep eastern face, from Ambleside via the long ridge of Middle Dodd, or as part of a horseshoe walk incorporating Dove Crag and Hart Crag. The summit features a trig point surrounded by a substantial wind shelter, with the small Red Screes Tarn nestled just below to the west, offering spectacular views across the Central and Eastern Fells with particularly impressive perspectives of Windermere and the Coniston range. The eastern slopes drop dramatically into Kirkstone Pass through a series of rocky outcrops and scree slopes, while the western aspects descend more gradually into the head of Scandale. The predominantly rocky upper terrain supports limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species, while the lower slopes feature areas of heather moorland and coarse grassland typical of the Eastern Fells. The mountain's strategic position above Kirkstone Pass, the Lake District's highest road crossing, ensures it remains a popular objective despite the steep ascent required from most directions.
2404,Sheffield Pike,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Cumberland,"4,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL5N,673.2,2209,NY373178,NY 37350 17877,208.9,NY 3688 1925,464.3,ground 30m NNE of cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=437350&Y=517877&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.550795,-2.970435",Sheffield Pike rises above the western shores of Ullswater between the valleys of Glencoyne and Glenridding, its unusual name possibly deriving from "sheep fold hill" rather than having any connection to the Yorkshire city. The fell's history is closely tied to the lead mining industry that once dominated Glenridding, with old mining tracks crisscrossing its eastern slopes. Most walkers approach from Glenridding via the old miners' track to Nick Head, or from Glencoyne via the connecting ridge from Heron Pike. The summit area features a cairn though the actual highest point is on featureless ground about 30 meters north-northeast, offering superb views across Ullswater toward Place Fell and the Far Eastern Fells. The eastern slopes bear the scars of historic mining activity, with drainage channels, spoil heaps, and abandoned workings providing insights into the industrial heritage of the area. The predominantly grassy upper slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, with areas of heather and bilberry on the middle reaches, while the lower slopes give way to bracken and eventually the ancient oak woodland that lines the shores of Ullswater. Despite being overshadowed by its more famous neighbors, Sheffield Pike offers excellent walking with historical interest and spectacular Ullswater panoramas.
2405,Steeple,Lake District - Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"W,B,Sy,Fel",89,OL4S,818.9,2687,NY158112,NY 15803 11264,2,NY159113,817,cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=415803&Y=511264&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.490369,-3.298883",Steeple forms a dramatic rocky pinnacle extending northward from the main ridge connecting Scoat Fell to Pillar, its distinctive profile living up to the descriptive name given by early Lake District pioneers. Despite having minimal prominence from its parent fell Scoat Fell, Wainwright considered it worthy of separate fell status due to its striking appearance and character. Most walkers approach along the high ridge from either Scoat Fell or Pillar, with the short detour from the main ridge being rewarded by exceptional views and an exciting sense of exposure. The summit, marked by a small cairn on a narrow rocky top, offers spectacular views across Ennerdale to the High Stile range and north toward Loweswater and Crummock Water. The northern face drops precipitously toward Ennerdale in a series of impressive crags that provide challenging rock climbing routes, while the southern aspect connects directly back to Scoat Fell via a narrow ridge. The predominantly rocky terrain supports minimal vegetation, mainly hardy montane species surviving in crevices and sheltered spots. Despite its satellite status to Scoat Fell, Steeple's distinctive profile and the thrilling detour required to reach its summit ensure it remains a popular objective for those traversing the high ridges between Wasdale and Ennerdale.
2406,Yewbarrow,Lake District - Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"Hu,Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89,OL4S,627.3,2058,NY176084,NY 17620 08441,276.8,NY 1882 0733,350.6,S summit ground 10m S of shelter,,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=417620&Y=508441&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.461552,-3.270777",Yewbarrow presents one of the most distinctive profiles in the Lake District, forming a perfect ridge resembling an upturned boat when viewed from Wasdale Head. The fell derives its name from the Old Norse "ewe berg" meaning "ewe hill," though ironically its steep sides make it more suitable for goats than sheep. Most walkers approach from Overbeck Bridge via the steep southern nose known as Stirrup Crag, or from Dore Head via the slightly less challenging northern end. The summit ridge extends for over a kilometer with the highest point being found at the southern end near a small stone shelter, offering exceptional views across Wastwater to the Scafell range and comprehensive panoramas of the surrounding Western Fells. The eastern face drops precipitously into Mosedale through a series of impressive crags, while the western slopes descend steeply toward Over Beck and Wastwater. The predominantly rocky terrain supports limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species in sheltered locations, while the lower slopes give way to areas of heather moorland and scattered juniper bushes. Despite its relatively modest height, Yewbarrow's challenging ascent routes and spectacular views make it a favorite among connoisseurs of the Lake District fells, with Wainwright himself describing it as "the perfect mountain."
2407,Haystacks,Lake District - Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"3,W,B,Sy,Fel",89,OL4S,582.9,1913,NY197130,NY 19707 13028,146.3,NY 2045 1367,436.5,cairn,highest of three separate tops,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=419707&Y=513028&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.503417,-3.234343",Haystacks, though modest in height, ranks among the most beloved of all Lake District fells, famously Alfred Wainwright's favorite mountain where his ashes were scattered at Innominate Tarn. The fell presents a complex topography of rocky knolls, secluded tarns, and surprising diversity packed into a small area, quite unlike the simpler structure of many larger mountains. Most walkers approach from Buttermere via Scarth Gap Pass, or from Honister Pass via the old quarry roads above Warnscale Bottom. The highest point, marked by a cairn on one of three separate tops, offers superb views of Buttermere, Crummock Water, and the surrounding higher fells, with the perspective of Fleetwith Pike's dramatic face being particularly impressive. The summit area features several small tarns, with the tranquil Innominate Tarn being the most significant due to its association with Wainwright. The predominantly rocky terrain creates a varied environment supporting diverse plant life, including several alpine species in the numerous sheltered niches. Despite its modest height, Haystacks offers a genuinely adventurous mountain experience with some easy scrambling required in places, combining outstanding views with intimate touches that reveal themselves only to those who explore its complex summit thoroughly.

The fell's name derives from the Old Norse "kause" meaning a heap or pile, aptly describing its appearance. Most walkers approach from Braithwaite via Stonycroft Gill or from Rigg Beck in the Newlands Valley, with the final section involving an entertaining scramble up the stepped rock formations that give the eastern ridge its distinctive appearance. The summit, marked by a rocky outcrop on a rugged top, offers exceptional panoramic views across Derwentwater to the Helvellyn range, with particularly impressive perspectives down the length of the Newlands Valley. The northern slopes drop steeply toward Stoneycroft Gill, while the western ridge continues toward Sail and forms part of the popular Coledale Horseshoe walk. The predominantly rocky upper terrain gives way to heather and bilberry on the middle slopes, while the lower reaches feature bracken and scattered trees in the more sheltered gullies. Despite being overshadowed in height by some of its neighbors, Causey Pike's distinctive profile, relatively straightforward access from Keswick, and the entertaining scramble to its summit ensure its popularity with walkers of all abilities.
2409,Wandope,Lake District - North Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,771.5,2531,NY183189,NY 18357 18908,35,NY177175,736,cairn,,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=418357&Y=518908&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.558885,-3.261353",Wandope forms a modest subsidiary summit on the ridge extending southwest from Crag Hill, its broad grassy dome creating a marked contrast to the more dramatic surrounding peaks. The fell's name derives from the Old Norse "wanthop" meaning "hill with a shaking bog," referring to the sometimes waterlogged nature of its slopes after heavy rain. Most walkers encounter Wandope while traversing between Crag Hill and Whiteless Pike, with few choosing it as a direct objective despite the excellent views it offers. The summit, marked by a simple cairn, provides superb panoramas across the Northwestern Fells with particularly impressive perspectives of Grasmoor's imposing eastern face. The western slopes drop sharply into Addacomb Hole, a dramatic corrie carved by glacial action, while the eastern flanks descend more gradually toward the head of the Rannerdale valley. The predominantly grassy upper terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with few rocky features to break the smooth contours that characterize this section of the Northwestern Fells. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by its higher and more distinctive neighbors, Wandope's position ensures it provides excellent views and forms an important link in the popular horseshoe walks around both Buttermere and Newlands valleys.
2410,Grasmere Common/Stone Arthur,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Westmorland and Furness,"3,W,B,Fel,Sy",90,OL5S,499.1,1638,NY347091,NY 34718 09159,24,NY351086,475,cairn,summit area is approximately 500m N of Stone Arthur,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=434718&Y=509159&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.472881,-3.006854",Stone Arthur forms a dramatic rocky promontory on the long ridge descending northeast from Great Rigg toward Grasmere village. Despite its limited prominence from the surrounding ridge, Wainwright considered it worthy of fell status due to its distinctive character and the excellent views it offers over Grasmoor. Most walkers encounter Stone Arthur while ascending or descending the popular path between Grasmere and the main Helvellyn ridge, with the rocky outcrop providing a natural resting point with outstanding views. The actual highest point, marked by a cairn, is found about 500 meters north of the main Stone Arthur outcrop on the featureless grassy ridge known as Grasmere Common, though many walkers mistakenly believe the more dramatic rocky projection to be the summit. From either point, hikers enjoy superb views across Grasmere lake and village to the Coniston fells beyond, with Helm Crag's distinctive profile particularly prominent in the foreground. The predominantly rocky terrain around Stone Arthur gives way to expansive areas of grass and heather on Grasmere Common, while the lower slopes feature bracken and scattered trees that eventually merge with the ancient deciduous woodland surrounding Grasmoor. Despite its modest height, Stone Arthur's strategic position directly above Grasmere village and its easily accessible nature make it a popular objective for those seeking impressive views without a full mountain ascent.
