The fell represents the start (or end) point of the popular Helvellyn ridge traverse, with many walkers beginning this extended mountain journey from the peaceful village of Dockray. Most approach routes follow well-established paths either from Dockray via Randerside or from the Old Coach Road that crosses the northern slopes. The summit area features a large cairn built on the site of a former trig point, with the actual highest point being found on featureless ground about 35 meters north, offering expansive views toward Blencathra, the Northern Fells, and across the Eden Valley to the Pennines. The predominantly grassy slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, while the eastern flanks are bisected by the deep ravine of Groove Beck which plunges spectacularly toward Deepdale. Despite its considerable height, Great Dodd has relatively gentle contours compared to some of its neighbors further south along the ridge, making it accessible in most weather conditions and popular with walkers seeking excellent views without extreme exposure.
2385,Stybarrow Dodd,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL5N,843.3,2767,NY345183,NY 34508 18336,72.2,NY 3458 1903,771.1,cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=434508&Y=518336&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.554363,-3.009929",Stybarrow Dodd occupies a central position on the ridge connecting the Helvellyn range to the Northern Fells, forming a broad, grass-covered dome that lacks the dramatic features of some neighboring mountains. The fell's name derives from the Norse "stigi-biorg" meaning "the precipitous pass," likely referring to Sticks Pass which crosses its eastern shoulder and forms an ancient route between the valleys of Patterdale and Thirlmere. Most walkers encounter Stybarrow Dodd while traversing the ridge between Raise and Watson's Dodd, with direct approaches possible from Sticks Pass or via the Old Coach Road to the north. The modest summit cairn marks the highest point on an otherwise gently rounded plateau, offering superb panoramic views across the central Lake District with particularly impressive perspectives of Helvellyn's northern face. The eastern slopes descend steeply toward Stanah and the Thirlmere valley, while the western flanks drop more gradually toward Glencoyne and Ullswater. The predominantly grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with occasional outcrops of rock providing variety to the otherwise smooth profile that characterizes much of this section of the Helvellyn range.
2386,Hayeswater Fell/The Knott,Lake District - Far Eastern Fells,EL06,Westmorland and Furness,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90 91,OL5N,738.8,2424,NY422124,NY 42290 12421,176.9,NY 4070 1230,561.9,small cairn by fence corner,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=442290&Y=512421&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.502008,-2.883680",The Knott, or Hayeswater Fell as it is sometimes known, rises as a rounded hump at the end of a ridge extending westward from High Street, forming an important link between the High Street range and the mountains around Patterdale. The fell derives its name simply from the Old English "cnocc" meaning "small hill," an understated description for what is actually quite a substantial mountain. Most walkers encounter The Knott while traveling between High Street and Rest Dodd, approaching via the clear path from the col at Satura Crag or from Hayeswater via the steep western slopes. The summit, marked by a small cairn at the corner of a fence, offers excellent views westward toward Ullswater and the central fells, with particularly impressive perspectives of the Helvellyn range. The western slopes descend steeply toward Hayeswater, a mountain tarn that once served as a reservoir for Penrith but has now been returned to its natural state by United Utilities. The predominantly grassy upper slopes give way to areas of heather and bilberry on the middle reaches, while the lower areas around Hayeswater feature scattered rowans and willows in the more sheltered gullies.
2387,Harter Fell (Eskdale),Lake District - Southern Fells,EL03 Scafell-illgill,Westmorland and Furness,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,W,B,HHB,Sy,Fel",96,OL6S,649.3,2130,SD218997,SD 21889 99734,273.6,SD 2327 0138,375.7,highest of cairns on rocky surface,highest of 3 rocky tors,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=321889&Y=499734&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.385975,-3.206546",Harter Fell rises dramatically above the head of Eskdale, forming a distinctive skyline with its three rocky summit tors creating a memorable profile when viewed from the valley below. The mountain occupies a pivotal position between Eskdale and the Duddon Valley, providing an important link between the Southern and Western Fells. Most walkers approach from Jubilee Bridge in upper Eskdale via the path past Penny Hill Farm, or from Hardknott Pass following the old Roman road before striking up to the summit. The highest point is found on the central of three rocky tors, marked by a cairn and offering spectacular panoramic views across to the Scafell range, the Coniston fells, and south toward Morecambe Bay. The upper slopes feature extensive areas of rock and heather, while lower down the mountain is clothed in mixed woodland, particularly along the course of the River Esk. The fell's name derives from the Old English "heorot" meaning hart or stag, suggesting it was once an important deer habitat, while its diverse terrain continues to support a range of wildlife including ravens, buzzards, and occasionally ring ouzels in the higher rocky outcrops.
2388,Catstycam,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5S,889.7,2919,NY347154,NY 34722 15436,129.8,NY 3513 1522,759.9,cairn,,very obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=434722&Y=515436&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.529270,-3.009298",Catstycam presents one of the most perfectly shaped pyramidal peaks in the Lake District, rising dramatically above Red Tarn with a symmetry that many consider more aesthetically pleasing than its famous neighbor, Helvellyn. The mountain's Norse name translates as "the cat's high ridge," though it was temporarily renamed Catchedicam on Ordnance Survey maps during the Victorian era. Most walkers approach from Glenridding via the path to Red Tarn before making the steep ascent up the mountain's southeastern ridge, though challenging scrambling routes exist on the northern face for experienced mountaineers. The small summit plateau features a simple cairn and offers spectacular views of Helvellyn's impressive eastern crags and ridges, as well as panoramic vistas across Ullswater and the Eastern Fells. The western slopes connect to Swirral Edge, one of the two famous ridges leading to Helvellyn, while the northern and eastern faces drop precipitously through rocky terrain toward the valleys below. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, mainly hardy montane species adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes give way to heather moorland and eventually the mixed woodland that lines the shores of Ullswater.
2389,Seat Sandal,Lake District - Eastern Fells,EL05,Westmorland and Furness,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5S,736,2415,NY350103,NY 35022 10392,218,NY354122,518,cairn,ground 10m NW may be of similar height,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=435022&Y=510392&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.483620,-3.004832",Seat Sandal rises as a compact, rounded fell between the valleys of Grisedale and Tongue Gill, standing somewhat apart from its neighbors and thus providing excellent views in all directions. The mountain's unusual name likely derives from the Old Norse "s√¶tr sandr haugr" meaning "the hill of the dairy farm on sandy soil." Most walkers approach from Dunmail Raise via the steep eastern slopes, or from Grisedale Tarn via the gentler southwestern ridge, with the latter route forming part of the popular Coast to Coast long-distance path. The summit, marked by a substantial cairn, offers superb panoramic views with particularly impressive perspectives of Fairfield and Helvellyn. The northern slopes descend steeply toward Grisedale Tarn, one of the Lake District's most significant mountain lakes and the legendary resting place of the crown of Dunmail, the last king of Cumberland. The predominantly grassy upper slopes support hardy upland sheep grazing, while the lower reaches feature patches of bracken and scattered boulders, remnants of the area's glacial past. Despite its modest height compared to some neighbors, Seat Sandal's isolated position makes it an excellent viewpoint and a worthy objective for walkers exploring this central part of the Lake District.

The fell derives its straightforward name from its position at the "head" of the Newlands "dale" or valley. Most walkers approach from either Honister Pass via the old tramway path or along the spectacular ridge from Hindscarth, with additional routes possible from Newlands Valley or Borrowdale. The summit features an impressive cairn constructed as a cylindrical pillar on a platform, offering exceptional panoramic views with particularly dramatic perspectives down the length of Newlands Valley. The eastern face drops precipitously through a series of crags into Borrowdale, contrasting with the more gradually sloping western flanks that descend toward Newlands. The predominantly rocky upper slopes support limited vegetation, while lower down, areas of heather and bilberry give way to bracken and eventually the lush pastures of Newlands Valley. Dale Head forms an integral part of the popular Newlands Horseshoe, one of the classic circular walks in the Lake District that combines excellent ridge walking with constantly changing perspectives.
2391,Skiddaw,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Ma,F,Sim,Hew,N,HHB,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,930.4,3052,NY260290,NY 26043 29080,705.7,NY 3713 3065,224.7,rock 5m S of trig point,ground 30m E at NY 26073 29083 is of similar height,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=426043&Y=529080&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.651449,-3.151079",Skiddaw stands as the fourth highest mountain in England and dominates the northern horizon of Keswick with its distinctive smooth, broad profile. The mountain consists primarily of slate dating back some 500 million years, making it among the oldest rock formations in the Lake District. Most walkers approach via the well-maintained tourist path from Keswick, though more challenging and scenic routes exist from Millbeck, Bassenthwaite, or the back of the mountain via Skiddaw House. The summit plateau features a trig point and nearby rocks marking the highest point, offering exceptional panoramic views across the northern lakes, the Solway Firth to Scotland, and on exceptionally clear days as far as Wales, the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland. The predominantly grassy upper slopes create a stark contrast to the more rugged mountains of the central Lake District, though the eastern flanks are bisected by dramatic gills including Roughton Gill and Southerndale. The mountain's rich history includes Bronze Age settlements, while more recently, its unique geology has attracted scientific interest for the rare minerals found in the Skiddaw granite intrusion, including wolfram and scheelite.
2392,Grisedale Pike,Lake District - North Western Fells,EL02 Gable-grasmoor,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,791.5,2597,NY199219,NY 19945 21944,422.5,NY 2213 2062,369,summits 150m apart of similar height,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=419945&Y=521944&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.585957,-3.232323",Grisedale Pike presents one of the most distinctive profiles in the North Western Fells, its perfectly triangular shape creating a striking landmark when viewed from Keswick and the surrounding valleys. The mountain derives its name from the Old Norse "griis-dalr" meaning "valley of the young pigs," referring to the wild boar that once roamed the area. Most walkers approach from Braithwaite via the steep, clearly defined ridge that leads directly to the summit, though alternative routes exist from Whinlatter Pass or along the connecting ridge from Hobcarton Crag. The summit area actually consists of two tops of similar height about 150 meters apart, both offering spectacular views across Keswick and Derwentwater to the Helvellyn range, with particularly impressive perspectives down the length of Coledale. The eastern slopes drop dramatically toward Braithwaite, creating the distinctive pyramidal profile for which the mountain is renowned, while the western flanks descend more gradually toward Coledale. Grisedale Pike forms an integral part of the popular Coledale Horseshoe, one of the classic circular walks in the Lake District that takes in numerous summits while maintaining consistently high elevation.
