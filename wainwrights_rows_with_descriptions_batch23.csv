The fell's name likely derives from the Old Norse "grár" meaning "gray" and "krákr" meaning "rock," reflecting its rocky upper slopes. Most walkers approach from the nearby village of Hartsop via the path that ascends through the fields and woodland of the lower slopes, or from Kirkstone Pass via the path that follows the ridge from Red Screes. The summit is marked by a small cairn and offers superb views across the Far Eastern Fells, with particularly impressive perspectives of Ullswater and the Pennines. The northern slopes descend gently toward the shores of Ullswater, while the southern aspect drops more steeply into the valley of Aira Beck. The predominantly grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with few rocky features to break the smooth contours that characterize much of this section of the Far Eastern Fells. Despite its modest height, Gray Crag's strategic position above Ullswater and its easily accessible nature make it a popular objective for those seeking impressive views without a full mountain ascent.
