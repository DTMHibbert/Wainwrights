The mountain offers a relatively straightforward ascent via the well-trodden tourist path from Keswick, making it popular despite its considerable height. From its summit, visitors enjoy panoramic views across the northern lakes, Derwentwater, and on clear days as far as Scotland and the Isle of Man. Skiddaw is part of the Skiddaw Group of slate, dating back some 500 million years, making it among the oldest rock formations in the Lake District. The upper slopes feature alpine-type vegetation adapted to the harsh conditions, while the lower slopes are home to heather moorland and woodland.
2320,Blencathra,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Westmorland and Furness,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,HHB,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5S,867.8,2847,NY323277,NY 32345 27708,461,NY296287,407,rock 1m N of trig point,ground 30m W at NY 32314 27710 may be of similar height,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=432345&Y=527708&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.638347,-3.049384",Often called Saddleback due to its distinctive shape, Blencathra offers some of the most exciting ridge walking in the Lake District, including the famous Sharp Edge scramble for experienced hikers. The fell consists of six separate fell tops and provides diverse routes of ascent ranging from gentle walks to challenging scrambles. From its summit, climbers are rewarded with expansive views over the Solway Firth, northern Pennines, and much of the Lake District. Blencathra's geological makeup consists primarily of Skiddaw slate, and the mountain has been a backdrop for local sheep farming for centuries. The fell's slopes support resilient upland vegetation and provide habitat for birds of prey and mountain wildlife.
2321,Skiddaw Little Man,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,HHB,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,865,2838,NY266277,NY 26676 27792,60.6,NY 2650 2808,804.4,rock 5m N of cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=426676&Y=527792&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.638126,-3.141448",Skiddaw Little Man stands as a distinctive peak on the southern shoulder of its parent mountain, Skiddaw, creating an appealing profile when viewed from Keswick. Though sometimes considered merely a subsidiary summit, this fell has earned its place as a Wainwright in its own right due to its distinct character and the fine views it offers. The most popular ascent route is via the well-maintained path from Keswick that continues on to Skiddaw, making it a frequent stopping point for those tackling the larger mountain. From its summit, walkers enjoy spectacular views of Derwentwater, Keswick, and the surrounding northern fells. The exposed position means the peak often experiences strong winds, but the clearly defined path makes it accessible for moderately experienced hikers.

The fell is characterized by its rounded profile and extensive grassy slopes, which contrast with the more rugged terrain found elsewhere in the Lake District. From its summit, marked by a small pile of stones, hikers can enjoy excellent views of Bassenthwaite Lake and the Solway Firth to the north and west. The most popular ascent route is from the Dodd Wood car park, which provides a steady climb through woodland before emerging onto open fellside. Carl Side serves as an important link in the horseshoe walk that takes in Skiddaw, Skiddaw Little Man, and Longside Edge.
2326,Long Side,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,734,2408,NY248284,NY 24880 28444,39,NY251283,695,cairn,ground 35m W at NY 24844 28447 is of similar height,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=424880&Y=528444&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.645171,-3.167571",Long Side extends westward from Carl Side as part of the northern ridge descending from Skiddaw, forming a prominent profile when viewed from Bassenthwaite Lake. The fell features a distinctive, elongated summit ridge that gives it its name, with steep northern slopes dropping dramatically toward Southerndale. Hikers typically reach Long Side as part of the Skiddaw horseshoe walk, enjoying particularly fine views across Bassenthwaite Lake and toward the Solway Coast. The summit, marked by a small cairn, sits at the eastern end of the ridge and provides a sense of isolation despite its proximity to more popular fells. The grassy terrain offers straightforward walking, making it accessible to moderately experienced hikers, though the ridge can be exposed during adverse weather.
2327,Lonscale Fell,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4S,715,2346,NY285271,NY 28545 27144,52,NY280273,663,no feature: ground 25m S of cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=428545&Y=527144&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.633022,-3.110921",Lonscale Fell forms the southeastern spur of the Skiddaw massif, distinguished by its dramatic eastern face where steep slopes drop sharply toward the Glenderaterra Valley. The fell offers a variety of ascent routes, with the most popular being from Keswick via the well-maintained bridleway known as Gale Road, or from the Blencathra Centre along the old railway line. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by its more famous neighbors, Lonscale Fell rewards visitors with extensive views toward Derwentwater and the central fells from its gently rounded summit. The western slopes feature extensive grassy terrain, while the eastern crags provide a more challenging aspect that appeals to scramblers and rock climbers. Wildlife enthusiasts may spot ravens and peregrine falcons soaring around the eastern crags, particularly during the breeding season.
2328,Knott,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Cumberland,"Ma,Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",89 90,OL4N,710.1,2330,NY296329,NY 29617 32984,242.2,NY 2784 3037,467.9,cairn,,obvious summit,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=429617&Y=532984&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.685305,-3.095396",Knott stands as one of the more remote fells in the Northern Lake District, characterized by its broad, grassy dome and extensive summit plateau. Despite being the second highest peak in the Northern Fells after Skiddaw, it remains relatively quiet due to its distance from popular starting points and the lack of dramatic features that attract casual visitors. The fell offers a sense of solitude and wilderness, with the most common approaches being from Mosedale or via the connecting ridge from Great Calva. From its summit cairn, hikers enjoy panoramic views across the Northern Fells, with particularly good vistas toward the Caldbeck Fells and the Border hills. The extensive grassy terrain supports grazing for Herdwick sheep, and careful observers may spot mountain hares which inhabit the higher slopes. The flat summit area can become boggy after rain, typical of many of the Northern Fells.
2329,Bowscale Fell,Lake District - Northern Fells,EL01 Skiddaw-knott,Westmorland and Furness,"Sim,Hew,N,W,B,Sy,Fel",90,OL5N OL5S,702,2303,NY333305,NY 33339 30541,87,NY327291,615,stone shelter,cairn 8m E may be higher,Abney level,"https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=433339&Y=530541&A=Y&Z=115","https://www.google.com/maps/place/54.664552,-3.031778",Bowscale Fell rises as a rounded dome to the east of the Caldew valley, forming part of the eastern boundary of the Northern Fells. The mountain is best known for Bowscale Tarn, a small corrie lake nestled on its northern flank, which legend claims is home to immortal fish. Walkers typically approach from the village of Mungrisdale to the east or from the Caldew valley to the west, with the latter route passing through the remote and picturesque Mosedale. From the summit, marked by a stone shelter and nearby cairn, hikers enjoy extensive views eastward toward the Pennines and Cross Fell, as well as westward to Blencathra and the Northern Fells. The broad, grassy slopes support typical upland vegetation and provide grazing for Herdwick sheep, with occasional sightings of red deer in the quieter areas. The ridge connecting to Bannerdale Crags offers a pleasant high-level traverse with minimal height loss.

The fell's shapely pyramid appears particularly impressive when viewed from Bassenthwaite Lake, where it stands as a perfect counterpoint to the bulk of Skiddaw behind. Most walkers ascend from the Ravenstone Hotel or Dodd Wood, tackling a steep but rewarding climb up the narrow, grassy ridge. The summit, marked by a small rocky outcrop, offers spectacular views over Bassenthwaite Lake and toward the Solway Firth. Ullock Pike forms part of a popular horseshoe walk with Long Side and Carl Side, eventually leading to Skiddaw itself. The western slopes drop steeply into Southerndale, creating dramatic terrain that contrasts with the gentler eastern aspects that connect to Carlside.
