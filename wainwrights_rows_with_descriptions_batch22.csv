The fell's name reflects its commanding position as the high point of the ridge that extends from Wether Hill to Rampsgill Head. Most walkers encounter High Raise while traversing the high ridge from Loadpot Hill to Rampsgill Head, with direct approaches possible from Martindale via The Nab or from Hartsop via Hayeswater. The summit features a substantial cairn and offers spectacular panoramic views across the Far Eastern Fells, with particularly impressive perspectives of Ullswater, Haweswater, and the Pennines. The northern slopes descend steeply into Martindale, while the southern aspect drops more gradually toward the head of Riggindale. The predominantly grassy terrain supports hardy upland sheep grazing, with few rocky features to break the smooth contours that characterize much of this section of the Far Eastern Fells. Despite its relatively gentle slopes, High Raise's considerable height and strategic position on the high ridge ensure it remains a popular objective for walkers exploring the Far Eastern Fells.
